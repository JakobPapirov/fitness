# fitness
English: Personal fitness website. In one circle of a venn diagram there's "fitness" and in the other there's "WebDev" (mainly). 
The intersection of these is http://fitness.jakobpapirov.se

Currently I'm focusing on writing the content of the site in Swedish, but I intend to write an English version as well.
Some parts are in English though. I shoudl really standardise this.
