# Fitness
English: Personal fitness website. In one circle of a venn diagram there's "fitness" and in the other there's "WebDev" (mainly). 
The intersection of these is http://fitness.jakobpapirov.se

Currently I'm focusing on writing the content of the site in Swedish, but I intend to write an English version as well.
Some parts are in English though. I should really standardise this.

# Master branch : V. 2.0 +
I'm in the process of re-writing the site in Bootstrap 5.0 (from 3.3.6/7). Quite a lot of functionality isn't done yet. I'm also planning to automate stuff as I'm learning backend (NodeJS) and extend previous functionality.

##Plan is

* Backend:      ExpressJS, EJS
* Login:        Passport, bcrypt, MongoDB (Atlas)
* Blog:         MongoDB (Atlas)
* Stats:        MySQl, Sequilze
  * Calculations - unsure (nodejs/mathjs, python/vue)
* Macros:       MongoDB (Atlas)

V. 2.0 Started in June 2020, published Jan 01, 2021
