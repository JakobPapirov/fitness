# Fitness
English: Personal fitness website. In one circle of a venn diagram there's "fitness" and in the other there's "WebDev" (mainly). 
The intersection of these is http://fitness.jakobpapirov.se

Currently I'm focusing on writing the content of the site in Swedish, but I intend to write an English version as well.
Some parts are in English though. I should really standardise this.

# Master branch : V. 2.0 
I'm in the process of re-writing the site in Bootstrap 5.0 (from 3.3.6/7). Quite a lot of functionality isn't done yet. I'm also planning to automate stuff as I'm learning backend (NodeJS) and extend previous functionality.


# V. 1.0 Branch : V. 1.0
This legacy site can be viewed at http://projects.jakobpapirov.se/fitness

# Legacy Branch : Early version of what became the 1.0 version
